# COVID data analysis

Data for this project originally downloaded from: <https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths> and then cleaned and transformed in excel, before being uploaded to a database.
The goal of this project is to demonstrated some of my SQL abilities. Particularly in creating and using temporary tables, as well as preparing data for visualisation.
